# Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.

jobs:
  # First Job: Build the project
  build: # New job for building

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Use the latest version

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4 # Use the latest version
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Or your desired Node.js version (e.g., '18', '20')
          cache: 'npm' # Caches npm dependencies to speed up subsequent runs

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'npm ci' is preferred over 'npm install' in CI environments

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build # This command builds your Vue.js project into the 'dist' folder

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3 # This uploads the 'dist' folder as a deployable artifact
        with:
          path: './dist' # This must match the output folder of 'npm run build'

  # Second Job: Deploy the artifact to GitHub Pages
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build # This ensures the 'deploy' job runs only AFTER the 'build' job successfully completes

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4 # This action deploys the artifact uploaded by the 'build' job
